# CS361-Microservice

This is a microservice made for my CS 361 class, it takes an item name from the game Minecraft and returns a image of the recipe for that item.

It returns an image of the first crafting recipe on the wiki page for a given item, whether that be under obtaining or usage.


## Usage:
- Example http request: `GET http://localhost:2000/recipe/enchanting table`
    - In JavaScript: `fetch("http://localhost:2000/recipe/enchanting table");`
- Returns http content-type `image/jpeg`
